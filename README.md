# ðŸš€ Innovative iOS App with OCR and ChatGPT

Excited to share a major milestone! We've built an innovative iOS application that combines the power of OCR and ChatGPT to respond to image queries/questions with incredible speed and accuracy.

## Key Features

- **Text Recognition**: Utilizes Vision Kit for seamless text recognition from images.
- **Intelligent Responses**: Integrated ChatGPT API to deliver intelligent responses in under 13 seconds.
- **Accessibility**: Responses are read aloud using Appleâ€™s AVSpeechSynthesis, enhancing accessibility and user experience.

## Detailed Features

### Vision Kit

Vision Kit is a powerful framework provided by Apple for text and image analysis. It offers robust tools for detecting and recognizing text within images, which is essential for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) functionality. With Vision Kit, our app can accurately and efficiently extract text from images captured by the user, enabling a wide range of applications from document scanning to real-time translation.

### AVSpeechSynthesis

Appleâ€™s AVSpeechSynthesis is a part of the AVFoundation framework that provides a text-to-speech (TTS) engine, enabling applications to generate spoken audio from text. This feature helps create more accessible and interactive applications by reading out content aloud. It offers customizable voices, adjustable speech parameters, and multilingual support, allowing for a personalized and engaging user experience.

## Backend Infrastructure

- **Azure-hosted Python Server**: Ensures efficient data processing and streamlined performance. By hosting our backend on Azure, we leverage Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to handle the dynamic scaling and robust performance needed for our application's needs.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Xcode
- CocoaPods
- An Azure account for the backend server

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   \`\`\`sh
   git clone https://github.com/DeepBhupatkar/QueryBox-AI-Powered.git
   \`\`\`

2. Install CocoaPods dependencies:
   \`\`\`sh
   cd QueryBox-AI-Powered
   pod install
   \`\`\`

3. Open the project in Xcode:
   \`\`\`sh
   open QueryBox.xcworkspace
   \`\`\`

4. Set up your Azure backend and configure the API endpoints in your project.

### Usage

1. Run the app on the simulator or a physical device.
2. Use the app to capture text from images and receive audio responses through AVSpeechSynthesis.
